<h1>These are the rules for Diplomacy as they pertain to use with the Diplomacy Discord bot. Rules may vary slightly from those in vanilla Diplomacy.</h1>
<p>General rules:</p>
<nav>
<ul>
<li>Diplomacy is set in early-20th century Europe, in 1914, the beginning of WW1.</li>
<li>Diplomacy is based around strategy and backstabbing, including secretive messaging. If you are uncomfortable being DM'd or talking in public voice chats, I highly recommend against playing in public servers.</li>
<li>There is no luck involved in Diplomacy, and no randomness aside from initial asignment.</li>
<li>Diplomacy is all about backstabbing.</li>
</ul>
</nav>
<p>Beginning a game:</p>
<nav>
<ul>
<li>Join a game. You will be randomly assigned a country out of England, Italy, France, Russia, the Ottoman Empire (Turkey), Austria-Hungary, or Germany. It's crucial to strategy that you don't get to pick this.</li>
<li>The game will begin when 7 players have joined. This discord bot only supports 7-player games. Sorry.</li>
<li>Each turn you will discuss with other people what you plan to do. You do not have to do what you say you will do. The bot will auto-delete any commands you send.</li>
</ul>
</nav>
<p>Moving:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are four commands: move, support, convoy, and hold.</li>
<li>In a move command, you attempt to move your unit to an adjacent location. If another unit occupies that location, your move will fail. If another unit attempts to move into that location, both moves will fail.</li>
<li>Only navy troupes can move into water.
<li>In a support command, you support a troup from yourself or another player in an adjacent location, without moving your unit. If another unit moves into the current location of your troup, the support command will fail.
</ul>
</nav>
